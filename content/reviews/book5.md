### Overview
This book explores the dual systems of the human mind: System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate). Kahneman explains how these systems shape our judgments, decisions, and behaviors in everyday life.  

### Key Concepts
- **System 1 vs System 2:** Instant intuitive responses vs. deliberate thinking  
- **Cognitive biases:** Errors in judgment, like overconfidence, loss aversion, and anchoring  
- **Prospect theory:** People value gains and losses differently, affecting decision-making  
- **Framing effects:** How the way choices are presented can influence decisions  

### Personal Review
Itâ€™s a mind-opening book that helps understand why humans often make irrational decisions. Excellent for anyone interested in psychology, economics, or improving decision-making skills.
